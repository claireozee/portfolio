            <h2>Coding Society</h2>
            <h5 class="blogpost-subtitle">June 2022</h5>
            <p>Upon restarting university, completing the #100DaysofCode challenge and discovering an interest in technology, I was looking for opportunities to develop my coding skills. I also realised that there wasn't a society that existed within my university at the time. I thought that if I were looking for a community to join, I'm sure others were too... so I started the <strong>Queen Mary Coding Society</strong> in <strong>September 2020</strong>.</p>
        </br>
            <h4><u>Aims</u></h4>
            <p>I learnt my lesson from the #100DaysOfCode challenge about the importance of defining clear goals in the beginning, so my first step was to exactly that. I defined the aims of the society for the 20/21 academic year, which were to:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Create a <strong>community of 50 coders</strong> within the university</li>
                <li>Allow members with all levels of experience to <strong>develop their skills</strong></li>
                <li>Demonstrate the <strong>opportunities</strong> that exist within the tech industry</li>
              </ol>
            <p>I used these aims as a guideline before making any decisions regarding the society, which made planning a lot easier because there was a vision I was working towards. The second step was to plan events in line with those aims, and I emphasised this in the welcome event when introducing the society to all the students.</p>
        </br>
            <h4><u>How?</u></h4>
            <p>Since we were still returning to normality after COVID, the academic year (and consequently, all the society events) were hosted online, which made things a bit easier. I knew I could use social media to reach more people. I knew that in order to achieve these goals and build a community of people who remain, I'd have to host </p>
            I understood that it wasn't just about hosting as many events as possible, but having a productive variety which can cater to people of different levels.

            <ol>
              <li>Hosting both <strong>social and educational events</strong></li>
              <li>Themed <strong>challenges and workshops</strong> between the events</li>
              <li>Sharing <strong>resources</strong> to help students develop their coding skills</li>
            </ol>


            I knew that the biggest challenge I'd face was forming a committee. ...
        mailing list containing weekly emails (reminder of event being hosted, any opportunities of interships I was aware of, coding challenge at the bottom of the email, links to )
        keeping active and posting on fb, linkedin, whatsapp gc, QMSU

      <h4><u>Responsibilities</u></h4>
      <p>There were a few crucial roles needed for the successful running of the society, and I fulfilled all of them in the first academic year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>President</strong> - overseeing the society as a whole and ensuring everything is inline with the aims </li>
        <li><strong>Treasurer</strong> - ensuring the funds from the annual membership fee were spent properly</li>
        <li><strong>Events manager</strong> - thinking of event ideas and overseeing the running of the society events to ensure they're successful</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing/publicity officer</strong> - social media engagement and ensuring all our events were posted accross all of our social media platforms</li>
        <li><strong>Communications officer</strong> - sending out weekly emails to members subscribed to the mailing list</li>
      </ul>
        </br>
        <h4><u>Challenges faced</u></h4>
        <p>no committee - all me. wanted to host a variety of events but becasue O was only a beginner, I could only host beginner friendly sessions. some members of the society suggested things that i could do to improve which was good, because i learnt from it and took it on board for second year. people with more experience, delegated responsibility etc, and didn't host all events. eg web scraping, building a discord bot and the fintech collab</p>

        2 events I wasn't able to fulfil - code in gaming/vr and hackathon - lot going on at the time etc, value of a team. just announced unable to and hosted other events arount it

        second semester, less consistent events becaus of exams etc
            
            <p>The Queen Mary Coding Society is here to create a community of coders and computer programmers within the university. Programming has a wide range of applications and we aim to explore some of them through exciting social and educational events, including bi-annual hackathons. </br>
                We understand that learning to code is like learning a new language; it requires patience and has to be practiced often in order to develop and become fluent. Because of this, we send weekly resources to our members to enable their development and have created a ‘student Stack Overflow’ within our WhatsApp group chat i.e., a student community where everyone has the opportunity to share their knowledge. 
                
                
                
                I decided to start the Queen Mary Coding Society in the midst of the pandemic in 2020. I understood the importance of community and decided to use it as a tool to bring people together, since students were experiencing the same problem of having limited social interactions. There were 3 main aims of the society which were all met within the first 3 months: create a community of coders within the university where there will be educational and social events, enable members with all levels of experience to develop their skills, and demonstrate the opportunities existing within the technology industry.
                In setting 3 tangible, clear aims when the society was founded, it helped to set the direction and  plan events to work towards achieving the aims. In the 21/22 academic year, I decided to continue the same goals which we had in the previous academic year, but to pass it on to the new committee. As a result of it, we’ve had many success stories including a member completing a summer internship and obtaining a technology grad job at LSEG, and people developing a new-found interest in coding. Today, there are 60 paid members in this academic year, and 221 members in the WhatsApp group chat where students use it as a “student stackoverflow”, a place where everyone can find the answers to their coding peoplems, where they can’t find it on Google.

        <h4><u>Does this differ from working in an early stage startup?</u></h4>
        <p>My answer? No. Although I've not actually worked for a startup of any size, from what I've read and understood about that environment vs working in an established institution (which I have done), my answer remains as no. Your answer to the question? You tell me...</p>

            <h5 class="blogpost-subtitle">August 2020</h5>
            <p>The <a href='https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/' target="_blank">CodeFirst: Girls'</a> web development courses was where I had my first introduction into the tech industry. I built a basic static site using HTML, CSS and some minor JavaScript, and later went on to integrate an API using Python. Upon then attending their annual conference at Twitter HQ UK in <strong>October 2019</strong>, that's when I first saw the variety of opportunities that exist within the tech industry. My eyes were opened and I realised that there was a lot more to tech than what I saw. I remember one robotics session in particular where we had the opportunity to input code to determine the robot's direction of movement, but the most memorable part of the day was hearing different people's journeys within the industry. There was a panel of various women in tech and that's where I heard the stories of some people who had developed their skills through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I also decided to start on that same day. Here's how mine went.</p>
            </br>
            <h4>I had two main aims:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to as many tech events as possible</li>
              <li>Develop my skills</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Looking back now, I can see how vague and undefined those goals are, but I'll get onto that shortly. In order to achieve those goals, I exposed myself to as much technology as possible (which in itself has it pros and cons).
            <li>I looked for events on LinkedIn, mailing lists I was subscribed to, meet & greet in the Google offices, a cloud insights event at Google, Microsoft 

            </li>
            <li>Watched tutorials on youtube on web development in order to further my understanding.</li>
            <li>I subscribed to <a href='https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/' target="_blank">Daily Coding Problem</a>'s mailing list and completed <i>some</i> of the interview style questions</li>
            <li>I helped a friend with his website for his </li></p>
           
            <div class="code-images">
              <img class="code-image" src="static/images/twitter.jpeg" >
              <img class="code-image" src="static/images/google.jpg">
            <img class="code-image" src="static/images/google2.jpg">
            <img class="code-image" src="static/images/microsoft.jpg" >
            </div><br/>
            <br/>

            I had three main goals ... what I did to achieve them was I went to tech events, networked within the community, build my skills
                html, css, python, js, daily coding challenges<br/><br/>

            <h4>Lessons learnt:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Developing a skill require a lot of time to be invested in it</li>
              <li>Breaks are necessary otherwise learning is counterproductive</li>
              <li>Opportunities are out there - create them if you can't find them</li>
            </ol>
            With that being said, I went on to creating a Coding Society at university when I realised that there wasn't one for me to join.
            
            
            

            Looking back now, what I'd do differently is to set myself a goal with a tangible result.
